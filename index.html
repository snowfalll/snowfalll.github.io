    Mangas are like comic books, but are mainly created in Japan. These sort of books are read from right to left, unlike the American style of reading left to right. The style of manga books was created during the late 1900s, although the style of the art itself is said to be created around the 12th century. There is a wide range of types of mangas- action, romance, games, sports, fiction, mystery, horror, science fiction and many others. People of all ages read manga in Japan from little kids to grandparents. Almost always, mangas are made in black and white, but <i>sometimes</i> can be colored. If a manga sells well or becomes very famous, it will most likely be turned into an anime series. Sometimes, it is the opposite, and mangas are based on a previously made anime.  </center> </h3>

    What is anime?

    Anime is almost the same thing as manga, but is on TV and is animated. It is drawn by hand on computer. It also has very colorful and vibrant colors instead of just black and white. The first anime related thing was made in 1917. Like manga, all  ages watch anime, but mainly younger people watch it. There are many types of animes, just like manga (go look at the 'What is manga' to see which types of genres there are). Anime is classified into different categories. 
    <br>
    1.Shonen- These types of animes and mangas normally have a young male hero, but sometimes can have female protagonists as well. Aslo, Shonen things have a lot of action and fighting, for example, Fairy Tail.
    <br>
    2.Seinen- Has protagonists of the age 15-25 and normally contains more fighting than shonen anime. There are Seinen comedies as well though.
    <br>
    3.Shojo- Has female protagonists and is translated as "young girl". This type of anime and manga is aimed at kids from the age of ten to eighteen. Many are about action, adventure, and relationships. An example is, Phantom Thief Jeanne.
    <br>
    4.Josei- This type is typically made for adult women. It has to do with more realistic relationships than Shojo, and of course can have adventure, action, and more.
    <br>
    5.Kodomomuke- Kodomomuke is aimed at children. It is simple with fantasy stories(sometimes) and can teach kids valuable lessons as well. Doraemon, a Japanese Kodomomuke has been translated into many various languages in Asia and many kids watch it.
